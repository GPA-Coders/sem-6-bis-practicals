SQL Injection: Manipulates a database by inserting harmful SQL commands through user input.

2. What measures can be taken to secure sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access in the event of a Trojan infection?
Answer:
Regular Software Updates: Keep all software, especially operating systems and applications, up to date to patch vulnerabilities that Trojans could exploit.
Antivirus Software: Install and maintain reputable antivirus software to detect and remove Trojans and other malware.
Firewall Protection: Use firewalls to block unauthorized access to your network, which can help prevent Trojans from sending data back to attackers.
Data Encryption: Encrypt sensitive data so that even if access is gained, the data cannot be easily understood or misused.

3. What steps can be taken to secure email communication and prevent Trojan infections through email attachments or links?
Answer:
Use Email Security Solutions: Deploy advanced email security solutions that include spam filters, virus scanning, and phishing detection to identify and block malicious emails before they reach the user.
Enable Attachment Scanning: Configure email systems to automatically scan all incoming and outgoing attachments for malware. Restrict or block attachments with file types commonly associated with malware (e.g., .exe, .scr).
Implement Email Gateway Filters: Use email gateway filtering solutions to scrutinize emails for malicious links and attachments at the perimeter of your network.
Apply URL Filtering: Implement URL filters that block access to known malicious websites and verify the safety of URLs by checking against constantly updated databases.
